        <p>Delicious blue butter ice cream sandwiches</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon blue food coloring gel</li>
            <li>Rainbow sprinkles</li>   
            <li>1 quart vanilla or birthday cake–flavored ice cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. In a medium bowl stir together flour, baking soda, and baking powder. In a large mixing bowl beat butter with a hand mixer until softened. Gradually beat in sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg, vanilla, and food coloring. Gradually add flour mixture and beat until combined.</li>
            <li>Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Place rounded tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or just until done in center and edges are barely browned. Let cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely. When cooled, chill cookies in the freezer for about 30 minutes before filling.</li>
            <li>Place sprinkles in a shallow bowl and put in freezer to chill. Allow ice cream to soften at room temperature for 10 minutes before filling cookies.</li>
            <li>To fill cookies, place a small scoop of ice cream on bottom side of a chilled cookie. Top with another cookie. Press together until ice cream is squished to edges of cookies. Quickly roll edges in chilled sprinkles and place cookie sandwich in a container in the freezer. Repeat with remaining cookies, ice cream, and sprinkles.</li>
